Steps to set up repository when working with RStudio:

1. Install R packages recorded in the lock file ('renv.lock').
   - See renv package documentation for details:
     https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html

2. The lock file records the version of R used (specifically, it is R 4.0.3).
   Check to see whether your version of R matches the version in the lock file

3. Tell R where to pull data from and where to save data to
   - Run the file scripts-shared/create-user-specific-environ.R;
     this step will display an .Renviron file when working within RStudio
     
   - Within the .Renviron file, add the following lines. 
     Note that the dots '...' should be replaced with the relevant path;
     also note the use of forward slashes '/' (and not backslashes '\')
     when specifying paths
   
     path.pns.input_data = ".../Raw Data/PNS"
     path.pns.staged_data = ".../staged_data"
     path.pns.output_data = ".../output_data"
     path.pns.code = ".../PNS/scripts-studies"
     path.shared.code = ".../PNS/scripts-shared"
     
   - A restart of RStudio is required to enable the variables above to be
     called from within RStudio

4. (Windows OS users) Starting R 4.0.0, R for Windows uses a toolchain bundle 
   called rtools40. If you have not done so, install rtools40. 
   You still need to perform one additional step to be able to compile 
   R packages: you will need to put the location of Rtools make utilities
   on the PATH variable. One way is to add the following line to the 
   .Renviron file (a restart of RStudio is required each time new changes
   to the .Renviron file are made)
   
   PATH="${RTOOLS40_HOME}\usr\bin;${PATH}"
